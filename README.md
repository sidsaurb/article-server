# article-server

###### This project is made as an assignment for course cs654: Software Architecture being taught in winter semester 2015-16 under Prof. TV Prabhakar, IIT Kanpur.

This is a javascript based web server build with nodejs. It aims at demonstrating publisher/subscriber model of software architecture. Features of this platform:
* Plublishers can publish articles under some *categories*.
* Subscribers subscribe to *categories* of articles about which they like to read.
* Whenever a publisher publishes an article belonging to a *category*, all the subscribers who follow that *category* get notified about it.

The subscriber and publisher components are being implemented in form of android apps. Their link will be updated soon.
